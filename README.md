staySafe is a privacy-preserving platform for global hostel bookings. It allows travelers to prove they hold a valid passport — without ever revealing the actual document — using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) with Safe protocol. This protects user privacy while giving hostel owners confidence in the legitimacy of their guests.

What makes StaySafe unique is its compliance layer. Hostel owners can configure rules to:

1)Restrict bookings from specific countries

2)Enforce OFAC compliance by excluding sanctioned regions

3))Setting gender-specific dorms, where only women can book women-only dorms and men can book men-only dorms

3)Avoid collecting sensitive documents like passports or personal identity data

All bookings happen on-chain, and users must verify identity privately using a Self zk protocol, The verification proves key traits (e.g. valid passport with its attributes to query and verify onchain) while keeping the user fully anonymous, can share those which matters maintaining privacy.

Country Restrictions: Hostel owners set a list of banned countries in their dashboard

OFAC Compliance: Owners can enable an OFAC mode, automatically preventing bookings from sanctioned countries

Gender-Specific Dorms: Owners can specify that only women can book women’s dorms, and only men can book men’s dorms
These conditions are enforced before booking, using ZK proof validation, but no passport details are exposed to the owner
